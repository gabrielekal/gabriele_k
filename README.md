Welcome to the world of War, a card game of chance! Your goal in this game is to outwit your opponent and be the first player to capture all 52 cards. The game will conclude once one player holds all the cards.

Game Setup:

1. Deck Initialization: We begin by shuffling the deck into a random order, consisting of a total of 52 cards.
2. Card Ranking: In War, cards are ranked from highest to lowest as follows: Ace (A), King (K), Queen (Q), Jack (J), Ten (T), 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2. 
3.  Please note that nothing beats an Ace and a 2 beats nothing.
4. Distribution: Each player receives 26 cards in a random order.
5. Player Identification: The program will send you a welcome message and prompt you to enter your name. The second player will be the computer.
6. Player1 will be the first to play by pressing the Enter button.

Gameplay:

1. Round Initialization: For each round, you will see "Round 1", "Round 2", and so on. To start the round, simply press Enter, or if you wish to quit, type 'q'.
2. Card Reveal: As you press Enter, both cards drawn by Player1 and Player2 will be revealed.
3. Round Winner: We'll promptly inform you about the round's winner.
4. Card Comparison: The player with the higher-valued card claims both cards for their own.
5. Status Update: After each round, we'll display the round number and the number of cards held by each player. For example, "Round 1: Sara - 23 cards, Computer - 29 cards."
6. Tiebreaker: In case of a tie, both cards are discarded, and neither player gains cards. We'll show you the updated number of cards held by each player.
7. Continue the Battle: The rounds will continue until one player is left empty-handed. The battle persists!

Potential Endings:

1. Natural Ending: If you desire, you can continue playing until one player emerges as the ultimate victor, holding all the cards.
2. Forced Ending: You have the option to end the game by pressing 'q' at any time, in which case the game will come to a close.
