Welcome to the world of War, a card game of chance! Your goal in this game is to outwit your opponent and be the first player to capture all 52 cards. The game will conclude once one player holds all the cards.

Game Setup:

1. Deck Initialization: We begin by shuffling the deck into a random order, consisting of a total of 52 cards.
2. Card Ranking: In War, cards are ranked from highest to lowest as follows: Ace (A), King (K), Queen (Q), Jack (J), Ten (T), 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, and 2. 
3.  Please note that nothing beats an Ace and a 2 beats nothing.
4. Distribution: Each player receives 26 cards in a random order.
5. Player Identification: The program will prompt you to enter your name, and the second player will be the computer.
6. Random Start: The game randomly selects which player will go first.

Gameplay:

1. Round Initialization: For each round, you will see "Round 1", "Round 2", and so on. Press Enter to start the round or 'q' to quit the game.
2. Card Comparison: The player whose card holds a higher value claims both cards for their own. 
3. Status Update: After each round, the program will display the round number and the number of cards each player possesses. For example, "Round 1: Sara - 23 cards, Computer - 29 cards."
4. Tiebreaker: If a tie occurs, both cards are discarded, and neither player gains cards. The program will reveal the updated number of cards each player holds.
5. Continue the Battle: The rounds will persist until one player is left empty-handed.


Potential Endings:

1. Natural Ending: If you desire, you can continue playing until one player emerges as the ultimate victor, holding all the cards.
2. Forced Ending: You have the option to end the game by pressing 'q' at any time, in which case the game will come to a close.
